## What is Stake Blackjack?

Stake.us has quickly gained popularity for several reasons. A main reason is that it allows you to play a wide range of games without needing to make a purchase, yet still offers the chance to redeem prizes. Among this range of games is a collection called Stake Originals. This is an exclusive selection of games that includes titles like Stake Mines, Limbo, Dice, Plinko, Roulette, and Blackjack.

Stake Blackjack is one of the most popular games within this collection. Just like classic Blackjack games, the goal is to beat the dealer by getting a hand as close to 21 as possible.

However, what sets Stake Blackjack apart is its exceptionally low house edge of only 0.50%, translating to a return to player (RTP) rate of approximately 99.50%.

This is among the best for Blackjack games across the industry. Winning against the dealer with a regular hand pays out at 1:1, while a win with a Blackjack hand pays at 3:2, offering the potential for impressive wins.

## How to play Stake Blackjack
Once you've signed up and completed the Stake verification you can start playing. If you don't know how to play Blackjack at Stake.us, it is very simple. This is because the Stake Blackjack rules are essentially the same as any standard blackjack game.

The game starts with you being dealt two cards. Your decision at this point is to either stand, meaning you keep your current hand, or hit, where you ask the dealer for another card.Stake.us - Table games - Blackjack - game ss

You're allowed to stand with any hand value of 21 or below. However, choosing to stand with a low-value hand might give the dealer an advantage to reach 21 before you. On the other hand, if you choose to hit, you'll receive an additional card from the dealer.

But again, be careful when to hit because if you take a risk and hit with a hand that is already close to 21, there's a good chance that you will go bust.

Successfully playing Stake Casino Blackjack is all about knowing when to hit and stand at the right times to beat the dealer.

## Stake Blackjack strategies & tips

Luck significantly influences the outcome in Stake.us Blackjack, but skill also matters. With a strategic approach, you can beat the dealer and secure a win. Here are some tips and strategies to help you do just that.

### Avoid being overly ambitious
Chasing 21 in every round is tempting, but it's wise to hold your position if your hand totals 17 or above. Doing so keeps you in the game and gives you a good chance of beating the dealer. Taking unnecessary risks for a blackjack might lead to a bust, instantly resulting in a loss.

### Pay attention to the dealer's hand
Given the fact that you can see the dealer's cards, factor this into your decision-making process. For instance, if the dealer shows an Ace and a 7, totaling 17, you should adjust your strategy accordingly. In such cases, you might want to take greater risks to beat the dealer.

### Practice with Gold Coins
Since Gold Coins have no redeemable value, it's smart to use them to get comfortable with the game and practice your strategies. When you feel more confident, you can start playing with Stake Cash, where you can redeem winnings for prizes.
